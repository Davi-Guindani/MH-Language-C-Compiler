# MH Language C Compiler
A compiler made in C with the aim of making it possible to compile code in the "MH" language. MH is a fictional programming language proposed by my teacher of algorithms and programming techniques in high school. The language has only 4 essential commands, and was made with the objective of developing and exercising programming logic for beginners in the area. Previously, the exercises were corrected on paper, distancing the student from the common work environment of a programmer, which is the computer. After this project, it is now possible for students to study MH on the computer. This code originated from a course completion project by this teacher and is used today at school.
